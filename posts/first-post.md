## Run~Rent~Rehab _(noun)_

A virtual place where I get to share my passions; through tips, tricks, stories, and DIY tutorials. I love to restore life to older/used items (specifically houses), that I can then turn into long term rentals. When I'm not too busy with real estate, I love to feel the wind in my hair running outside.
